// This JSON file represents a collection of ads available for targeting.
// Each ad has the following structure:
// - category: The general category of the ad
// - message: The actual ad content to be displayed
// - targeting: Criteria for determining which users should see this ad
//   - age_range: An array of two integers representing the min and max age for targeting
//   - interests: An array of interests that the ad is relevant to
// In a real-world scenario, this would be a much larger dataset with more diverse ads
// and potentially more complex targeting criteria.
