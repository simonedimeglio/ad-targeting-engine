// This JSON file represents a simplified user database.
// Each user has a unique ID (e.g., "user1") and associated profile data:
// - age: The user's age (integer)
// - interests: An array of strings representing the user's interests
// In a real-world scenario, this would be replaced by a proper database
// and would include many more users and potentially more detailed profile information.
